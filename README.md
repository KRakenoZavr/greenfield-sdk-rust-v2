# greenfield-sdk-proto

Rust crate for interacting with Protobufs defined by the greenfield SDK.

The goal of this crate is to provide complete proto struct definitions for interacting
with a greenfield SDK blockchain.

Currently, this crate only provides a subset of the many total structs exported by
greenfield SDK proto files.

Pull requests to expand coverage are welcome.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate is supported on Rust **1.63** or newer.
