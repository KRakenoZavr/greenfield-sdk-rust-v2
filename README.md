### Rust Crate for Interacting with Protobufs in the Greenfield SDK Blockchain
Welcome to the Rust crate designed to enhance your interaction with Protobufs defined by the greenfield SDK. This library aims to provide complete proto struct definitions, empowering developers to build robust applications on the greenfield SDK blockchain.

#### Key Features
- Comprehensive Proto Struct Definitions: Unlike the existing limited subset of struct definitions, our crate offers a more complete set of proto struct definitions. This allows you to have a comprehensive understanding of the SDK's functionalities and leverage its full potential.

- Improved SDK Interoperability: With our crate, you can seamlessly communicate and interact with the greenfield SDK. By expanding the available struct definitions, we ensure a smoother integration process, making it easier for you to build applications on top of the SDK.

- Streamlined Development Process: Say goodbye to manually creating or modifying proto structs. Our crate's enriched proto struct definitions save you valuable time and effort, enabling you to focus on developing your blockchain applications. We handle the low-level implementation details, so you can focus on what matters most.

- Increased Developer Productivity: Our complete proto struct definitions empower you to work efficiently and productively. With predefined structures at your disposal, you can handle various data types and messages effectively. This productivity boost allows you to iterate faster, experiment with different SDK functionalities, and deliver high-quality blockchain applications in record time.

#### Community Collaboration
We believe in the power of community collaboration. By contributing to this crate, you actively foster an environment of knowledge sharing and growth. Other developers can benefit from your contributions, provide feedback, and contribute further improvements. Together, we can build a vibrant hub for SDK-related discussions and advancements.

#### Open Source Philosophy
This Rust crate aligns with the open-source philosophy, offering a valuable resource to the community free of charge. We strive to promote inclusivity and empower developers from all backgrounds and skill levels to interact with the greenfield SDK efficiently. Join us on this exciting journey of innovation and blockchain development possibilities.
